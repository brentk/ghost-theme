Custom [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org) theme by me, for [me](http://www.brentkelly.com).

This is my first attempt at building a responsive site manually, without the aid of tools like Bootstrap that hide the complexity from you.

While the css is from scratch (using SASS), the Handlebars templates are based heavily on the default Ghost theme, Casper.
